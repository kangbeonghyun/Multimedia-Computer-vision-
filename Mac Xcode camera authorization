I had trouble configuring xcode camera authorization.

I record this help someone like me(Mac os, xcode user, opencv)

My issue is when call 'VideoCapture cap' with below message:

[access] This app has crashed because it attempted to access privacy-sensitive 
data without a usage description.  The app's Info.plist must contain an 
NSCameraUsageDescription key with a string value explaining to the user how the app uses this data.

so i tried to add Info.plist(not 'i') in correct path with correct key(Privacy-Camera Usage Description,before vesion may NSCameraUsageDescription) 
and Value($(PRODUCT_NAME) camera use)(some say it is necessary,not optional).
i think, almost user may be try this method to solve problem.(it is necessary!)

But!,the error occurs yet...

I solved this problem with copy Info.plist->Xcode Navigator->open Products->your exec->then, right click->
show in finder-> paste Info.plist.(as i said, above process is first!)
